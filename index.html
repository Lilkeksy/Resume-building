            <p>
                My name is Kelvin Masetti, and I am proudly bi-racial, born to a Nigerian mother and an Italian father in Jos, Plateau State, Nigeria. 
                Growing up in Nigeria has profoundly shaped my identity and perspective. 
                I am a passionate Computer Science student with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence, currently studying at the American University of Nigeria. 
                My strengths include a deep understanding of various programming languages and web development technologies, 
                coupled with leadership experience gained through my involvement in several clubs and organizations. 
                I aspire to leverage my technical skills and creativity to develop innovative solutions that address real-world problems, 
                with a particular interest in advancing the field of artificial intelligence and cloud computing.
